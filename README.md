# Math-With-Gesture
In this project, I created a system that can solve mathematical problems using hand gestures and computer vision techniques. By leveraging OpenCV and MediaPipe libraries, we will develop a program that allows users to draw mathematical expressions on a surface, captures the gestures using a camera, and provides the solution with a step-by-step explanation.

## Objectives

1. Capture hand gestures using a camera and OpenCV.
2. Recognize and extract mathematical expressions from the hand gestures using MediaPipe.
3. Process the Hand gesture recognition and solve them using mathematical algorithms.
4. Display the solution and provide a step-by-step explanation.
